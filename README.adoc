# XYZ Reader Update UI

Fully revamped the style of the app including a new color scheme, a foldable toolbar, and animations. 

For some reason I can't get the images to show here no matter what solution I try. 
Screenshots of the app are located in the Screenshot folder where you can also find a gif of the animations in action.
